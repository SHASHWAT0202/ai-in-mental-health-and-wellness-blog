                        <p>To make things more concrete, here are a few of the ways AI is being applied in mental-health/ wellness domains:</p>

                            <p>Apps that engage users for mood tracking, provide psycho-education, guide CBT-style exercises via conversational interface. For example, some studies show mood improvement in users of such systems.</p>

                            <p>AI systems analysing voice patterns, speech or facial cues to detect depression/anxiety. One review reported models diagnosing ~90% of mental disorders using a 28-question set in a given study.</p>

                        <div class="highlight-box">
                            <p><em>Wellness is not just the absence of illness — it's the presence of balance. AI wellness tools like Serenity promote proactive care: daily mindfulness check-ins, gratitude prompts, and reflection exercises that align with age-old human principles — awareness, gratitude, and self-kindness.</em></p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>Beyond clinical therapy, AI is also influencing the broader concept of wellness — mental-wellbeing rather than pathology. Some changes include:</p>
                        
                        <ul class="feature-list">
                            <li><strong>24/7 availability:</strong> Digital tools available at any time, not just during office hours.</li>
                            <li><strong>Preventive focus:</strong> Rather than waiting for crises, AI-powered tools may help monitor, nudge, support lifestyle changes, resilience, coping before issues escalate.</li>
                            <li><strong>Data-driven insights:</strong> Wearables, smartphone sensors + AI can track sleep, activity, mood, social engagement — enabling personal wellness insights and early warnings.</li>
                            <li><strong>Scalability across geographies:</strong> Especially relevant in countries or regions with limited mental-health infrastructure (including India). AI/wellness apps may reach those otherwise underserved.</li>
                            <li><strong>Empowerment & self-management:</strong> Users can engage with apps/tools on their own terms — complementing traditional therapy or in some cases using AI tools as first-line support.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>If you're thinking about using AI-powered mental-health or wellness tools (or just want to be aware), here are some take-aways:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Choose tools/apps that have evidence (studies, peer review) behind them.</li>
                                <li>Prefer those that complement human care rather than totally replace it.</li>
                                <li>Check data-privacy, consent, transparency of how your data is used.</li>
                                <li>Use AI tools as support, not sole treatment — especially if you have moderate/severe mental-health issues.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                            <h3 class="subsection-title">What to be cautious about</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Be aware of over-reliance: if you're avoiding human care because you feel the tool "is enough", that may be risky.</li>
                                <li>If you're in crisis (suicidal thoughts, self-harm risk, severe point of distress), an AI app is not a substitute for a trained professional.</li>
                                <li>Question bold claims: technology is promising but not a miracle cure.</li>
                                <li>Consider cultural, linguistic and personal relevance: tools developed in one region might not transfer seamlessly to another.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                            <p>You might use AI wellness tools as part of your mental-health "toolbox":</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Use a chatbot for daily check-ins or mood tracking.</li>
                                <li>Use an app for guided meditation, CBT-style exercises between therapy sessions.</li>
                                <li>If you already see a therapist, mention the tools you use — they may help integrate them into your care plan.</li>
                                <li>Use your judgment: if a tool makes you feel worse, or you find you're depending on it excessively, reconsider.</li>

                            <li><strong>Generative AI & large-language-models:</strong> As models like GPT evolve, more advanced conversational agents may emerge, but with increased risk/responsibility.</li>
                            <li><strong>Biomarkers & multi-modal data:</strong> Combining voice, facial, physiological and behavioural data to create richer mental-health insights.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hybrid models:</strong> More care systems will integrate AI + human experts in combination (e.g., AI does screening and monitoring; human does therapy).</li>
                            <li><strong>Regulation & standards:</strong> As adoption rises, regulatory frameworks, ethical guidelines and best practices will become more important.</li>
                            <li><strong>Global reach, especially in low-resource settings:</strong> AI/wellness apps may play a major role in countries where mental-health infrastructure is limited — offering "first-line" support and monitoring.</li>
                            <li><strong>Focus on preventive wellness rather than reactive care:</strong> Wellness apps, mood trackers, resilience training may grow alongside clinical applications.</li>
